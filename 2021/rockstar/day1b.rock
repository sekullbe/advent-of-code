Rock the sonar
The ping is 3
The count is 0
The sea is deep
Distortion is new

Listen to the sea
Until the sea is mysterious
Burn the sea
Rock the sonar with the sea
Listen to the sea


While the ping is weaker than the sonar
Let the pong be the ping without distortion
Let the echo be the sonar at the ping
Let the reply be the sonar at the pong
Build the ping up
If the echo is stronger than the reply
build the count up


Shout the count
